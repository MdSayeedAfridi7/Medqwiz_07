The error you're encountering, "TypeError: questionList.filter is not a function," suggests that the `questionList` variable is not an array, and you're trying to call the `filter` method on it. The `filter` method can only be used on arrays, not on non-array objects.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that `questionList` is an array before calling the `filter` method on it. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
return {
    ...state,
    question: state?.question?.map((questionList) => {
        console.log(action?.payload?.deleteQuestionPayload?.question[0]?.id);
        console.log(questionList?.id);

        // Check if questionList is an array before calling filter
        if (Array.isArray(questionList) && questionList.length > 0 && questionList[0]?.id === action?.payload?.deleteQuestionPayload?.question[0]?.id) {
            // Use filter only if questionList is an array
            return questionList.filter((questions) => questions?.id !== action?.payload?.questionId);
        } else {
            return questionList;
        }
    })
}
```

This code first checks if `questionList` is an array and if it contains at least one element before attempting to use the `filter` method. If it's not an array, it returns `questionList` as is to avoid the TypeError.
